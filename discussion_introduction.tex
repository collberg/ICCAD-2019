Previous work on evaluating the energy impact from code obfuscation has made some simplifying assumptions: Sahin et al.~\cite{6976079} consider a few commercial obfuscation tools that only provide trivial transformations, Raj et al.~\cite{raj2017modelling} obfuscate by hand which prevents them from examining a large corpus of benchmarks, and Dukovi\'{c} and Varga~\cite{dhukovic2015load} target three commercial obfuscators that also only support trivial transformations such as {\em instruction substitution}. The real world is much messier than this. Industry standard software protection tools (such as those sold by IRDETO and Arxan\footnote{\url{https://irdeto.com} and \url{https://www.arxan.com}.}) support large numbers of transformations, each with multiple options, and with the ability to apply multiple layers of transformations to prevent a variety of reverse engineering attacks. 
The design of Tigress is similar. 

This means that any type of performance evaluation becomes difficult: for a ``real'' obfuscation tool there is no single ``obfuscation'' to evaluate, but rather an infinite space of possible sequences of transformations, each of which can be individually tweaked. Furthermore, the impact of a particular transformation on a particular application depends not only on the transformation, but on the structure of the application: applying the Flatten transformation to a straight-line program will have no impact, and neither will applying EncodeArithmetic to a program that has no integer arithmetic operations.

The problem is further exacerbated by the fact that the {\em real} question we want to have answered is not ``which sequence of obfuscating transformations will have the smallest performance impact,'' but rather ``which sequence of transformations will result in the smallest runtime, code size, and energy use, while maximizing resistance to reverse engineering attacks.'' {\em This}, of course, requires us to be able to measure the resilience to attack of individual and combined transformations which, in itself, is a problem that has yet to receive a satisfactory solution~\cite{banescu2017characterizing,wu2010framework}.

Never-the-less, in this paper, we have made a first step towards a methodology for obfuscation performance evaluation.
