\subsection{Performance acquisition}\label{subsec:pdoc}
%\JP{Fixed.Note : The Pi 3B+ benefited from a change to the way the system-on-chip (SoC) is attached to the circuit board, allowing it to better dissipate heat. And all the factors such as power draw,performance varies with different versions of Pi.https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi/raspberry-pi-specs-benchmarks/}

We acquire power values by directly recording current and voltage values from the Keysight Benchvue Power Supply. The calculations are done by recording current and voltage values every 0.1 second for the 5 executions of the obfuscated codes. These values are then averaged and subtracted from the idle RPi state power consumption of 2.2805 watts. This gives the  average power consumed by the obfuscated code execution.

The energy consumed is computed as $P_\mathit{avg} \times t_\mathit{avg}$, where $P_\mathit{avg}$ is the average power consumed over the execution of the obfuscated target program and $t_\mathit{avg}$ is the average execution time. To elaborate, each execution of the obfuscated target file generates several power samples (based on our chosen sampling rate of 0.1 seconds for the SMU), which are averaged to result in $P_\mathit{avg}$.
