%
% The "author" command and its associated commands are used to define the authors and their affiliations.
% Of note is the shared affiliation of the first two authors, and the "authornote" and "authornotemark" commands
% used to denote shared contribution to the research.


%
% By default, the full list of authors will be used in the page headers. Often, this list is too long, and will overlap
% other information printed in the page headers. This command allows the author to define a more concise list
% of authors' names for this purpose.
