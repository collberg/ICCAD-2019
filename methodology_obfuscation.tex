\subsection{Obfuscating Transformations}

\input{tigress_options.tex}

In our experiments we use the Tigress C source-to-source obfuscator. Tigress supports a wide range of transformations, and each transformation has multiple options that controls how the obfuscated code is generated. Table~\ref{tab:tigress} shows the Tigress transformations, options, and range of option values that we used in our experiments.

\begin{figure*}
\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}{12cm}
\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle=\footnotesize]
tigress --Seed=42 --Transform=InitOpaque --Functions=main \
   --Transform=Virtualize --Functions=foo --VirtualizeDispatch=direct \
   --Transform=AddOpaque --Functions=foo --AddOpaqueCount=20 --out=output.c input.c
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}
\caption{Example Tigress invocation.}
\label{fig:tigresscall}
\end{figure*}

Figure~\ref{fig:tigresscall} shows a  call to Tigress to transform a C program {\tt input.c} into {\tt output.c}. This particular invocation first applies the {\tt Virtualize} transformation to the function named {\tt foo} using {\em direct} dispatch, and then adds 20 opaque predicates to the virtualized {\tt foo}. This is a very typical use of an obfuscator, applying multiple transformations to the same function, in order to protect against different types of attack. Note that a {\em seed} can be given to Tigress, which randomizes all internal decisions and allows multiple, differently obfuscated, programs to be generated from the same input program. This is used to generate a diverse set of programs, making it more difficult for an adversary to create generalized attack scripts that work across many obfuscated programs. 

In our experiments, we do not combine transformations, but only apply one at a time to each of the benchmarks. For each transformation we run all possible combinations of the values of all options shown in Table~\ref{tab:tigress}. This results in 16 variants for \emph{Virtualize}, 128 variants for \emph{Merge}, 35 variants for \emph{Split}, 75 variants for \emph{AddOpaque}, 128 variants for \emph{Flatten}, 1 variant for \emph{EncodeArithmetic} and 3 variants for \emph{EncodeLiteral}. 

We apply each transformation variant to all the functions in each benchmark. In practice, this is unrealistic; in most scenarios only security-sensitive functions are obfuscated to avoid too much overhead. For the MiBench benchmarks, however, it is unclear which part of the code should be considered ``security-sensitive,'' and we therefore transform the entire program.


After transformation, the resulting program is compiled with gcc version 4.6 using the command: \texttt{gcc -O2 -lm -Wall -o obfuscated.exe obfuscated\_input.c}. The resulting program is stripped of symbols.

When functions are not inlined, there is a performance hit to make a function call.
Function calls (depending on the platform) typically involve a few 10s of instructions, and that's including saving / restoring the stack. Some function calls consist a jump and return instruction.
But there are other things that might impact function call performance and energy as a result. The function being called may not be loaded into the processor's cache, causing a cache miss and forcing the memory controller to grab the function from main RAM. Hence function calls may or may not impact performance and energy.

\AR{Dr.Collberg: Can you add a short description of these options? Just stating it wouldn't make send to a reviewer. Else, how about having a table for this? Transformation | Options | Description}
\subsubsection{Virtualize}
Virtualize involves transforming a function into an interpretor, whose bytecode language is specialized for the particular function specified. 



\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{--VirtualizeDispatch=[direct,indirect and switch]}.
\item \textit{--VirtualizeSuperOpsRatio=[2 and 0]}.
\item \textit{--VirtualizeMaxMergeLength=[5 and 0]}.
\item \textit{--VirtualizePerformance=[AddressSizeShort, CacheTop and PointerStack]}.
\item \textit{--VirtualizeOperands=[stack and registers]}.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{AddOpaque}
Split up control flow by adding opaque branches.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{--AddOpaqueKinds=[bug and junk]}
\item \textit{--AddOpaqueCount=[1,5,10,15 and 20]}
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Encode Arithmetic}
Encode arithmetic replaces integer arithmetic expression with more complex expression. Tigress currently supports one option for this transformation.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{--EncodeArithmetic}.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Encode Literal}
This technique obfuscates string and integer literals with less obvious expression. A single option of encoding integer and string is utilized.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{--EncodeLiterals=[Integer and String]}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Flatten}
Remove control flow from a function.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{--FlattenDispatch=[switch, goto and indirect]}.
\item \textit{--FlattenSplitBasicBlocks=[true and false]}.
\end{itemize}



\subsubsection{Merge}
This transformation technique merges multiple functions together into one. The following options are supported in Tigress: 

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{--MergeFlatten=[true and false]}.
\item \textit{--MergeFlattenDispatch=[goto,indirect and switch]}.
\item Split \textit{--MergeSplitBasicBlocks=[true and false]}.
\item Randomize \textit{--MergeSplitBasicBlocks	=[true and false]}.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Split}
Split transformation breaks a function into less conspicuous pieces that are their own functions. The option utilized for this transformation is an attempt at the number of times the splitting needs to be performed. 

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{--SplitCount=[1,5,10 and 15]}.
\end{itemize}
